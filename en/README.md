> A collection of SOPs, guides, and insights at the intersection of AI and Web3.

## Welcome

Hi, I'm **king**, a contributor to the x402 protocol and ranked in the top 4% globally on the Cursor 2025 leaderboard.

After developing multiple AI x Web3 projects, we've come to realize that **Agent Skills are the future** — AI is no longer just about chatting, but about intelligent agents that can invoke tools, execute tasks, and collaborate on complex workflows.

This white paper documents the SOPs, techniques, and insights we've gathered from hands-on practice, focusing on the **intersection of AI Agents and Web3**.

## What You'll Learn

- **AI Agent Workflows** — Practical SOPs for integrating AI tools like Claude, Gemini, and Notion
- **Skill Development** — How to build, deploy, and manage AI agent skills across platforms
- **Web3 Integration** — Connecting AI agents with blockchain and decentralized systems
- **Best Practices** — Patterns and anti-patterns from real-world implementations
