# AI x Web3 Programming White Paper

> A collection of SOPs, guides, and insights at the intersection of AI and Web3.

[中文版](./README.zh.md)

## Foreword

Hi, I'm **king**.

In 2025, I've come to realize that **Agent Skills are the future**—AI is no longer just about chatting, but about intelligent agents that can invoke tools, execute tasks, and collaborate on complex workflows.

I'm a **contributor to the x402 protocol** and ranked in the **top 4% globally** on the Cursor leaderboard this year, having developed multiple AI x Web3 projects. This white paper documents the SOPs, techniques, and insights I've gathered from hands-on practice, focusing on the **intersection of AI Agents and Web3**.

I'll keep updating with useful content as I learn more.
